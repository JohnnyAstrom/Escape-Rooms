**Inlämningsuppgift 2 – HTML/CSS-kurs: Escape Rooms & inlämningsuppgift 2 - Javascript**

**Part 1 - HTML/CSS Course**

This assignment is the first part of the project and forms part of the examination for the course "Web development - HTML & CSS".

**Mission Description**

The goal of the task is to implement a responsive layout and design for the homepage, according to the specifications of a UX designer.

The project is based on a brief from a fictitious company, which you can read here.

The design material is available via Figma: [Figma link.](https://www.figma.com/file/0CWDexKE9i3I3yZFiFeDCE)

**My Implementation: HTML/CSS course**

In my project I chose to use semantic HTML elements to create a clearer structure on the page and improve accessibility for all users. I focused on keeping the HTML structure simple and clear to facilitate future development.

To organize and maintain my CSS, I used the BEM (Block Element Modifier) ​​method. This helped me to structure the classes logically and efficiently.

Instead of using pixels, I chose rem as the main unit of measurement. This makes the design more flexible and responsive on different screen sizes.

To further improve the user experience, I implemented media queries. I focused on three specific breakpoints:

**Mobile view:** max-width 599px
**Tablets:** min-width 600px
**Desktop:** min-width 800px

These breakpoints ensure that the website adapts smoothly to different devices.

Once I was satisfied with the initial part of the project, I started exploring Sass and quickly discovered several advantages. Through the Live Sass Compiler in VS Code, it was easy to get started and implement features like variables and nesting.

**Sass Enhancements**

**Variables:** I replaced my color codes with Sass variables, which simplified future maintenance of the code.

**Nesting:** I implemented nesting to create a more structured and manageable CSS. In addition, I also used nesting for media queries, which gave me even better control over the project's responsive design.

**This submission has helped me both understand basic CSS and discover the benefits of using more advanced tools like Sass.**

**Part 2 - JavaScript Course**

**Mission Description**

**The Task**
In the previous task, you built a menu that’s only visible on wide screens. Now, you’ll create a version of the menu designed for mobile view.

The design is available in the same Figma project as the previous task, and the animation specifications are provided in a video file.

**My Implementation: JavaScript Course**

After downloading the required images from Figma, I started by adding the necessary HTML elements for the mobile menu. Next, I set up event listeners for the menu button and the close button in a new JavaScript file. With those in place, I moved on to styling the mobile menu and its content. Finally, I added transitions and transforms to make it look similar to the video file provided by our instructor.

**Some Thoughts So Far**

This project turned out to be more challenging than I initially thought, especially the animation part. The JavaScript portion wasn’t as demanding in my current implementation since I used minimal JavaScript code, opting to structure most of the mobile menu in HTML instead.

**This submission has shown me that sometimes things that look easy are actually more complex, while tasks that seem challenging can occasionally be simpler than expected. May the journey continue!**
